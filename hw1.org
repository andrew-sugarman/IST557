* Problem 1: Expected value of a sum of normal random variables
We are given: \(y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \) and \( y \in \mathbb{R} \)
To solve the expectation \( E[y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+ ... y_{N}] \) given \( N \in \mathbb{R} \), we can use the linearity of expectation:

\[

E[y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+ ... y_{N}] = E[y_{1}] + E[y_{2}] + E[y_{3}] + ... E[y_{N}]

]

Given that y is a Gaussian random variable with mean \mu, this expectation solves to be \(N*\mu \)
